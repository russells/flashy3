A flashy that runs three tri-colour LEDs.

- Uses an ATtiny43U, which has lots of IO (up to 16 pins available)

- Could use the ATtiny43U's built in boost converter to run off low voltages,
  although the hardware I've built hasn't used this as it's tricky to build on
  veroboard.  I've used pre-made 1.5V to 5V boost converters from pololu
  instead.

- Does not use QP-nano, unlike most of my other projects, because I couldn't
  make it fit inside 4K along with my code.  I'm sure it can be done, but the
  logic of this project isn't complex enough to require the framework, so I
  didn't put in the extra effort.

- Circuit diagram not supplied, yet.
