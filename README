A flashy that runs three tri-colour LEDs.

I want to use the ATtiny43U for this project (so I can run it off one AA
battery using the 43U's boost converter), and it appears that 4k flash ROM is
not enough to include QP-nano and the code required to run with that framework.
So do it in plain C instead.
